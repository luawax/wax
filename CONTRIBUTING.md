CONTRIBUTING
============

To enter in the Wax projects, a module has to prove that is simple to be used,
usable to build common patterns and of the kind that avoids boilerplate.

Contributions are accepted once discussed as an issue. Also, the most valuable
contribution at the moment is testing and proving that what is already done
is on the right way, i.e. using it and giving feedback you are really doing
a great contribution.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.
