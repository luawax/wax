wax.dirconf
  A parser for config files based on directives to be parsed sequentially with
  immediate error report (stop parsing on error) with strict predefined
  directives and completely Lua syntax compatible

waxp test
  Find tests based on configuration directive ^^module^^

type annotations
  use ``--@`` comment to indicate the line has a type annotation. It should be
  run by ``waxp test`` and be linked to the next function tests. In theory it
  can assert if under expected passed values a previsible value.

  This annotation can also be used to generate report on which functions made
  public by the module were not tested or if these tests failed.

  --@ wax.list(a:string|number) string|number

  has a different meaning as

  --@ wax.list(a:string) : string
  --@ wax.list(a:number) : number

  Consider using it do documentation also, as it is much more unambiguous. As
  the identifier part %w+%.%[%w%.]+ should be capable to unify different
  annotations under a signature block to be used as documentation.
